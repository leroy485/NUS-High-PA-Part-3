# NUS-High-PA-Part-3

In this Programming Assignment (PA), I created an application in JavaFX to simulate an online furniture store, where customers are able to order furniture.

The application features:
- Unique account login
- Virtual money
- Receiving points (bonuses)
- Discounts redeemed from points
- and more.
